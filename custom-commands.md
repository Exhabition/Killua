1. Ensure you have `rustup` installed, and have used it to install the latest stable version of Rust alongside the `wasm32-wasi` target
2. Change directory into `python-sandbox`
3. Run `cargo build --target=wasm32-wasi`, and be prepared to wait for a while
4. Change directory back into the main directory, and run `python custom.py`
